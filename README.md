# Playing with ANSI escape codes

I wanted to understand how ANSI escape codes could be used to format the text in Bash.

This repository contains scripts/examples that I'm using to help me learn.

I'm interested in how far I can take the colourise-markdown script and whether it becomes useful enough to use.
